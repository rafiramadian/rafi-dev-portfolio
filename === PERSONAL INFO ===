=== ABOUT ME ===
Your story: I am a passionate Flutter Developer with nearly three years of experience building high-quality, cross-platform applications. My journey began with a solid academic foundation at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia, but it was during my time at Alterra Academy that I sharpened my practical skills by developing a fully functional mobile application as a capstone project. Since then, I’ve advanced through various roles, including internships and freelance projects, where I delivered web and mobile solutions using Flutter. I’ve worked extensively with Firebase, RESTful and GraphQL APIs, and applied state management solutions like Bloc and Riverpod to create scalable, responsive apps.

Currently, I work as a Mobile Engineer at Ekuid, where I develop and maintain performance-driven applications for Android and iOS. I collaborate closely with designers and product managers to create user-friendly interfaces and ensure a seamless experience through CI/CD pipelines with Codemagic. In parallel, I also work as a Freelance Flutter Developer with the Applied Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (AAIL) in Hong Kong, where I help integrate AI-powered educational solutions into mobile and web applications. I utilize Firebase services, Riverpod for state management, and deploy Flutter Web applications via Firebase Hosting. In every project, I emphasize code quality, performance optimization, and maintainability to ensure long-term product scalability.

Background: Bachelor Degree (Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (2018 - Present)). Flutter Developer Student at Alterra Academy, Intern at PT Enoram Nusantara Optima, Freelance Developer at Applied Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.
